# prokopto.dev - nojs

An implementation of my personal site in HTML/CSS only.

## Why?

Well, JavaScript is an interesting beast, and many people have security concerns about it.
Also, asking people to execute such powerful and potentially dangerous code locally seems a little strange as an ask.

I'm also going to implement a (similar) terminal-esque interactive site, which will be a sort of beta. Then we will move to the JavaScript version being primary, with the non-JS version being secondary/a no-script option.

## What?

I wanted to make a personal site that felt my own. Something I did by hand. I have used other frameworks in the past, like Hugo. And I feel like, in a certain sense, I didn't learn too much by building those sites. I'm not endeavouring to be a front-end dev, but I definitely think everyone should know a little of this, and a little of that.

## Limitations

Well, my limitations are really that I won't be able to implement some of the more interesting features afforded by JavaScript.

These include:
- Auto-converting equations to LaTeX style images.ee
- Dymanic display of graphs, etc.
- Interaction via a console-line-like inteface.
